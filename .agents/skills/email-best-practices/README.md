# Email Best Practices Skill

A comprehensive agent skill for building production-ready email systems. Covers everything from DNS authentication to webhook processing, with a focus on deliverability, compliance, and reliability.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add resend/email-best-practices
```

## What This Skill Covers

**Getting Started**
- Planning which emails your app needs (password reset, verification, order confirmations)
- Setting up email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) so emails reach inboxes

**Sending Emails**
- Transactional email design (subject lines, content structure, mobile-first)
- Marketing email best practices (consent, segmentation, unsubscribe)
- Compliance requirements by region (CAN-SPAM, GDPR, CASL)

**Production Infrastructure**
- Idempotency and retry logic to prevent duplicates
- Webhook processing for delivery events
- Suppression lists and list hygiene automation
