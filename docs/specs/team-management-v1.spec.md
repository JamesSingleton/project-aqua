## Problem Statement

Swim coaches who manage competitive teams spend a disproportionate amount of time on administrative work that existing software handles poorly. A head coach who works both a high school program and a year-round club team must maintain separate rosters, re-enter the same swimmer data across desktop tools, manually track best times in spreadsheets, and rebuild meet lineups from scratch for every invitational. When the meet host sends an event file, the coach exports entries in Hy-Tek format, emails or uploads the pack, then manually merges results back into team records after the meet.

Legacy tools like Hy-Tek Team Manager remain the de facto standard for file interchange, but they require Windows installations, paid licenses that expire, and offer no coherent experience for coaches who belong to multiple programs. Modern alternatives optimize for different buyers: SwimTopia and SportsEngine Motion target club administrators with registration, billing, and volunteer workflows; SwimCloud bundles team management with meet hosting and paywalls basic entry efficiency behind a Pro tier; CommitSwimming offers a full product but starts at roughly $39/month with no free tier.

Coaches are left choosing between software built for club ops, software built for meet directors, or spreadsheets. None of these options treat the **visiting coach's daily workflow**—roster, entries, results, progression across programs—as the primary job to be done.

## Solution

Project Aqua is a modern, web-based team management platform built **coach-first**. Coaches manage swimmers on one or more teams from a single login, import rosters and meet files in industry-standard formats, build meet lineups with auto-populated seed times, export entry packs that hosts accept in Hy-Tek Meet Manager / SwimTopia / SwimCloud / TeamUnify, import results after meets, and track swimmer progression within each team and season.

v1 focuses exclusively on **visiting-team** workflows: the coach prepares their team's entries and consumes results from meets they attend. Host-side meet merge, timing consoles, and desktop meet management are explicitly deferred. The platform supports club, high school, college, and summer segments from a unified UX shell, with segment-specific depth phased so each audience gets a credible v1 without blocking others.

**Positioning:** Modern, coach-first team management for swimmers across club, high school, and college programs—one login for coaches who work multiple teams, bulletproof Hy-Tek/SDIF interchange, and honest progression tracking—with a credible path to meet management later.

81. As a platform owner, I want domain logic shared between web admin and a future desktop meet client, so that meet management can ship later without rewriting parsers.
82. As a platform owner, I want a future swimmer/parent profile to confirm cross-team identity linking, so that career progression across programs does not rely on coach global search (legal/PII safe).
83. As a platform owner, I want a future downloadable team app or mobile app to consume the same API and auth model, so that delivery channels can expand without forked business logic.

## Implementation Decisions

### Product posture

- **Visiting team only in v1.** Coaches export entries to meet hosts; Project Aqua does not merge other clubs' entry packs or run the meet.
- **Multi-segment shell at launch** with phased depth: club (SWIMS + SafeSport), high school (class year, divisions), college (eligibility metadata), summer (light compliance).
- **Segment launch independence:** high school can ship even if club SWIMS slips schedule.

### Tenancy and identity

- **Team = organization** is the tenant, billing, and authorization boundary.
- **Coaches are users** who may belong to many organizations via membership records with roles: `owner`, `head_coach`, `assistant_coach`, `admin`.
- **Swimmers have a global identity** with per-team **memberships** and per-season **enrollments** (training group, class year, eligibility).
- **v1 progression is per-team/season only.** Cross-team career linking deferred to v2+ via swimmer/parent profile confirmation. No coach-facing global swimmer search (PII/legal risk).

### Meet and entry model

- **Meet** belongs to a team; populated manually or from imported event files.
- **Meet commitment** tracks attendance intent: pending / committed / declined.
- **Meet entry** status: draft / approved / scratched; includes seed time and exhibition flag.
- **Relay legs:** four primary legs plus alternates #5–#8 where required.
- **Meet import/export** gated to `owner` and `head_coach` roles; plan features where applicable.

Meet entry state transitions:

```
draft → approved → scratched
         ↑__________|  (un-scratch back to approved where allowed)
```

### File interchange

- Shared parse/export library: HY3, CL2, EV3, HYV, SDIF/SD3, XLS, ZIP, CSV.
- **Export fidelity:** importable by Hy-Tek Meet Manager, SwimTopia, SwimCloud, TeamUnify; validated against golden corpus; byte-identical Hy-Tek output not required.
- **Dive events** in combined swim/dive meets detected and skipped with explicit `skippedDiveEvents` feedback.
- **ZIP packs** unpacked and routed to correct parser(s) atomically.

### Monetization

| Tier | Includes |
| ---- | -------- |
| **Free** | 1 coach seat; unlimited swimmers/meets; roster CRUD; meet entries with auto-populated best times; HY3/CL2/SDIF export; results import; per-team progression; SWIMS 3.0 for club teams |
| **Pro** | Additional coach seats; lineup suggestions; advanced analytics; priority support |

No swimmer or meet count caps on free tier.

### Modules to build or extend

- **Admin web app** — coach-facing UI for roster, meets, progression, settings.
- **Auth package** — Better Auth with organization plugin; org-scoped RBAC; plan feature gates.
- **DB package** — organizations, members, swimmers, team swimmer memberships, season enrollments, meets, meet events, meet entries, meet commitments, meet results, relay legs, best times, time standards.
- **Swim-formats package** — parsers/exporters for interchange formats; golden corpus tests.
- **Swim-core package** — athlete match, entry limits, QT validation, age rules, team types, plan limits.
- **Billing integration** — per-org subscription tiers (Polar or equivalent).

### Auth and compliance

- Every server action authenticates and authorizes internally.
- SafeSport/MAAPP gating for club/national team types before minor PII.
- SWIMS sync on free tier for club teams.

### Delivery

- v1: web SaaS (responsive browser).
- Architect for future desktop meet client, downloadable team app, mobile — shared domain packages.

### Segment phasing

| Segment | v1 depth |
| ------- | -------- |
| Club | SWIMS, SafeSport, USA Swimming ID |
| High school | Class year, host divisions, invitational workflow |
| College | Eligibility year metadata |
| Summer | Lighter onboarding |

## Testing Decisions

### What makes a good test

- Assert **external behavior** only: parsed domain objects, exported files importable by hosts, UI workflows produce correct artifacts, auth denies cross-team access.
- Do not test private parser internals when golden corpus coverage exists.
- Use **PII-stripped fixtures** from real meet packs; raw coach files never in git.

### Test seams (confirmed)

**Primary (highest seam):** End-to-end meet entry pipeline — import EV3/HYV → declare meet roster (relay-only + alternates) → build lineup with auto seed times → export HY3/CL2/SDIF → re-import results → assert best times and per-team progression updated.

**Secondary:** Multi-team coach session — switch org context; verify isolation; assistant cannot export when disallowed.

**Tertiary:** Roster import — CSV and CL2 packs → memberships with segment fields; row-level error reporting.

### Modules under test

- `@project-aqua/swim-formats` — golden corpus (legacy CTCC 2005 CL2 results, modern AZSI D0+G0, EV3/HYV events, entry packs, SDIF, rosters).
- `@project-aqua/swim-core` — entry limits, QT validation, athlete match.
- Admin meet workflow integration tests at the primary seam where present.

### Prior art

- Vitest golden corpus with documented fixture families (Meet Results, Meet Entries/Roster, Meet Events, SDIF).
- Domain helpers unit tests in swim-core.

## Out of Scope

- Parent/family portal
- Club billing / dues collection
- Volunteer signup / job management
- Video / race analysis
- Host meet merge (other clubs' entry packs)
- Desktop meet management / timing console / MMDB
- Offline downloadable desktop team app
- Cross-team career linking UI (v2+ via swimmer/parent profile)
- Global swimmer search for coaches

**Deferred but architected:** mobile app, downloadable team client, meet hosting, swimmer/parent profile.

## Further Notes

### Acceptance corpus

Real-world files from coach HS and club programs anchor v1. Sanitized mirrors live in swim-formats fixtures; seven ZIP packs fully mirrored. Golden path: Sonoran Desert Invitational or AZSI Regional (import events → lineup → export → results → progression).

### Competitive wedge

Free auto-populated seed times + free club SWIMS vs SwimCloud withholding auto best-times on free tier. Pro sells lineup intelligence and scale (extra coaches, analytics).

### Risks

1. Multi-segment ambition — phase depth per segment to avoid blocking launch.
2. Export acceptance — hosts are the judge; golden corpus + spot checks in real MM/SwimCloud required before marketing compatibility.
3. Career progression expectations — communicate per-team v1 scope until v2 profile linking.

### Domain vocabulary

Use consistently: visiting team, organization/team, membership, season enrollment, meet commitment, meet entry, event key, QT, exhibition, relay-only swimmer, SWIMS, SafeSport/MAAPP.
