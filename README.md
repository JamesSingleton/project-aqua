# Project Aqua

Project Aqua is a visiting-team swim coach SaaS for rosters, meet entries, results, workouts, attendance, and calendars.

The coach app covers meets your team attends. Host-team entry merging, a family portal, and a timing console are outside the current scope.

## Architecture

```text
Next.js client
  -> Next.js server actions and route handlers
     -> Better Auth session and team authorization
        -> Drizzle + postgres.js -> Neon Postgres
        -> AWS S3 SDK -> Neon Object Storage
```

The Next.js backend owns database queries, authorization, uploads, and deletes. Browser components call that backend. Public logos and avatars are served through a same-origin route that resolves the current Neon branch's storage endpoint.

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/admin` | Coach app |
| `apps/web` | Marketing site |
| `apps/desktop` | Electron app |
| `packages/db` | Drizzle schema, migrations, and queries |
| `packages/auth` | Better Auth configuration and authorization |
| `packages/storage` | Server-side logo and avatar storage |
| `packages/swim-core` | Swim domain logic |
| `packages/swim-formats` | Meet and roster parsers and exporters |
| `packages/reports` | PDF and print reports |
| `packages/ui` | Shared UI components |

## Local setup

Install Node.js 24+ and pnpm 11.22.0. [Create a Neon account](https://console.neon.tech), then choose or create a project in AWS Ohio (`aws-us-east-2`) or Frankfurt (`aws-eu-central-1`). Neon Object Storage is currently available in those regions.

Run from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm i -g neon

neon auth
neon link --no-env-pull
neon deploy
neon env pull --file .env.local
```

`neon.ts` declares the `team-logos` and `user-avatars` buckets. Linking first and deploying next provisions those buckets before their branch credentials are pulled.

Generate a Better Auth secret:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Set `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` in `.env.local`, then apply the schema and start the coach app:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev:admin
```

Open [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001), sign up, and create a team.

The repository ignores `.env.local`, `.neon`, and generated MCP configuration. Keep credentials and linked project identifiers in those local files.

## Migrate an existing installation

Create database and object-storage backups before cutover. Keep the existing `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and application URLs so imported sessions and authentication flows remain valid.

1. Stop application writes.
2. Complete the Neon setup above against a fresh target project.
3. Add `SOURCE_DATABASE_URL` with the existing direct Postgres connection to `.env.local`.
4. Apply the target schema, then import:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm migrate:existing
```

The importer:

- Refuses a target that already contains users or teams.
- Copies all `public` schema rows with `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`.
- Verifies every public table's row content, excluding the logo and avatar fields rewritten during image migration.
- Downloads existing public team logos and avatars, uploads them into the target branch, and rewrites their database values to branch-aware `/api/storage/` paths.
- Leaves the source database and objects unchanged.

The PostgreSQL client tools must be installed locally. Existing image URLs must remain anonymously readable during the import; a failed download stops the migration.

After the command succeeds, run the local user journeys against Neon before updating the application host. Keep the source read-only until the production smoke test passes, then remove `SOURCE_DATABASE_URL` from `.env.local`.

## Agent setup

The repository checks in the Neon skills installed by:

```bash
neon skills -y \
  --agent cursor \
  --agent claude-code \
  --skill neon \
  --skill neon-postgres \
  --skill neon-postgres-branches
```

After `neon link`, configure project-local OAuth MCP:

```bash
pnpm neon:mcp
```

The script reads the project ID from `.neon`, writes local Cursor and Claude Code configuration, and pins MCP tools to that project. Each agent requests Neon authorization on first use.

For a global Cursor installation with API-key authentication:

```bash
neon mcp -y --agent cursor --project-id <project-id>
```

This pins the tools to the selected project and reuses an existing compatible MCP key or mints a project-scoped key.

## Develop with branches

Neon branches copy the database and object storage together. Each feature can start with production-like rows and files, then change both in isolation.

Stop the app before switching branches:

```bash
neon checkout main
neon checkout dev-meet-import --create
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev:admin
```

`neon checkout` updates `.neon` and `.env.local`. Restarting the app loads the selected branch's database and storage credentials.

Inspect schema changes against the parent:

```bash
neon diff
```

Stop the app before returning:

```bash
neon checkout main
pnpm dev:admin
```

Git and Neon branches are separate. Commit Drizzle schema changes and generated migrations through Git; child-branch data is not merged into the parent.

Database and object-storage writes are isolated by Neon. Email, calendar, billing, and other third-party side effects are not. Leave those integration credentials empty on development branches unless you are using approved sandbox accounts. Production-derived branches can also contain sensitive data.

## Environment variables

Use [`.env.example`](.env.example) as the template.

| Variables | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Pooled application connection |
| `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` | Direct connection for Drizzle migrations |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Server-side storage credentials |
| `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`, `AWS_REGION` | Branch storage endpoint and region |
| `BETTER_AUTH_*`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` | Authentication and application origins |
| `RESEND_*`, `EMAIL_FROM` | Email delivery |
| `POLAR_*`, `STRIPE_*` | Billing integrations |
| `GOOGLE_*`, `MICROSOFT_*` | Social login and calendar integrations |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Optional AI features |
| `USA_SWIMMING_*` | Optional SWIMS integration |

Neon fills the database and `AWS_*` values. Configure application and integration values separately.

## Database changes

The Drizzle schema lives in `packages/db/src/schema/`. Committed migrations and metadata live in `packages/db/drizzle/`.

```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
```

Runtime traffic uses the pooled `DATABASE_URL`. Drizzle migrations prefer the direct `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`.

## Deployment

Three commands cover separate parts of a release:

```bash
neon deploy       # apply neon.ts infrastructure to the selected branch
pnpm db:migrate   # apply the Drizzle schema
pnpm build        # build the Next.js applications
```

`neon deploy` provisions backend services. Deploy the Next.js apps through the application host with the selected branch's database and storage variables plus the application secrets from `.env.example`.
