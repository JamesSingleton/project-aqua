          By creating an account you may use Project Aqua to manage roster,
          meets, workouts, calendar, and times for teams you belong to. Team
          owners control seats, billing, and who can import or export meet
          files.
        </p>
        <p>
          You own the data you enter. You grant us a license to host and process
          it so the product can run. Entry files you export are your submissions
          to whoever is putting the meet on. We are not the meet director and do
          not accept entries on their behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          Free, Pro, and Enterprise limits are described on the pricing page and
          in the app. We may change the product, including retiring features,
          with notice when a change removes a paid capability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The software is provided as-is. We are not liable for a meet rejecting
          a file, a missed entry deadline, or meet results you import. Do not
          use the service if you need a parent portal, dues collection, or a
          timing console. Those are out of scope.
