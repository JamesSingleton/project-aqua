          A faster swim from a results import updates the best time here. On the
          meet, you can still turn on a time standard to see who went under.

        <p>
          Compare times with a standard you entered: a JO or sectional cut, a
          high school standard, or a team record you typed in. Filter
          progression by training group when you only want one cohort. Team top
          times by event are there when you are staffing a relay.
