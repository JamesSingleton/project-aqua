        <p>
          Take roll from the calendar or the attendance list. The history stays
          with this team, so you can see who has been on deck before you name a
          relay.

        <p>
          Connect Google Calendar or Outlook, or share a team ICS feed. The feed
          belongs to that team. Switching from the club to the high school does
          not mix the two schedules.
